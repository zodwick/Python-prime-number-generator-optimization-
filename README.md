# Python-prime-number-generator-optimization-
Python script to generate first n prime numbers . Optimized by levels . Detailed time and optimization info given

The various optimizations done in each level are:
  v1 - no optimization
  v2 - added break
  v3 - filter out even
  v4 - filter out even in for loop directly
  v5 - limit search to half of i
  v6 - limit search to square root of i
  v7 - limit search to only previous prime numbers
  v8 - limit search to only previous prime numbers but checking for less than directly at list addition rather than during modulus check
  v9 - taking finding of sqrt of final number as constant outside
